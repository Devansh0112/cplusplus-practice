# C and C++ Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This folder contains code for practicing data structures and algorithms in C++.

The code includes implementations of data structures from scratch, as well as examples of how to use the STL library for algorithms.

## Files

- `linkedlist.cpp`, `stacks_linkedlist.cpp`, `queue_ll.cpp`: Implementations of linked list data structures.
- `sparse_tables.cpp`, `sparse_table_linked.cpp`: Implementations of sparse table data structures.
- `stacks_array.cpp`, `queue_arr.cpp`: Implementations of data structures using arrays.
- `stack_stl.cpp`, `queue_stl.cpp`: Examples of how to use the STL library for stacks and queues.
- `prac.cpp`: File containing practice problems or code examples.
- `exceptions.cpp`, `rethrowException.cpp`, `functionException.cpp`: Files related to exception handling.

## Compiling the Code

The specific steps for compiling the code will vary depending on your compiler and development environment. However, you will generally need to use a C or C++ compiler to compile the code. Once you have compiled the code, you can run the resulting executable files.
